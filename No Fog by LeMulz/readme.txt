So, what files did I edit?  
I dived into visualsettings.dat and tinkered with a few things.  Notably I increased rain particles and the minimum size for ripple effect as well as increased the range that DoF takes effect.  
I didn't mess with Clouds or anything else too specific
I edited all 4 timecycle files.  I basically focused solely on fog & chromatic aberration removal for all scenes & locations in the game
I zero'd all fog_density values in most weather files.  I left alone the weathers that look best with fog!
